# Sentiment-Analysis-Of-Text-Using-IBM-watson-NLU-and-tone-analyzer
IBM watson's Natural Language Understanding and Tone analyzer services are really helpful to get started in the field of Natural language processing for beginners.

Here I have attached a guide to get started with both the above mentioned services of IBM Watson.
I have utilized the services to implement a business Use case (Customer support) to integrate the results of the analysis with the Agent UI to make it available for the Agent to see and help him make his interaction with the customer better by understanding the sentiment of the text.

As part of this use case the text part from all three channels i.e. SMS/Email/Chat coming to the agent on its Workspaces is analyzed.
